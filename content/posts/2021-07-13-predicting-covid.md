* What You Know Can't Hurt?

One of my focuses during COVID has been trying to make sense out of this enormous event that has impacted us all in such profound ways, but was wholly ignored before the event. Given this, I have recently been reading Nassim Taleb's Black Swan again. Where else to turn to make sense of this event than to the modern master himself? 

## **What You Know Can't Hurt?**

One idea of his has really struck a chord with me and I can't quite get it out of my head: 

> What you know can't really hurt you.

Take Nassim's favourite example, the Turkey on Thanksgiving. It has been cared for and fed by its owner for 1000 straight days. The turkey has absolutely no reason to suspect that on day 1001 he will be killed and eaten. His human carers have always been great, regular feedings, water, plenty of space to wander around. Without learning human language and integrating with their culture, this turkey has no possible way of ever finding out about his impending doom. 

Yet when we apply this lesson to COVID it only half stacks up. There have been many warning shots across the bow of humanity when it comes to deadly viruses. We have records going back thousands of years which show evidence of plagues across the globe, far more devastating ones than we are currently experiencing. In recent years we have seen SARS, MERS, Ebola and Swine Flu. There were experts warning all of us. Yet we didn't listen. I am interested in why?

Perhaps it comes down to the difference between being *told* something and *knowing*. Whilst we had been warned by experts, not many people around the world (including those in power positions) have the expertise to really understand the dynamics of a viral outbreak and the uncertainties that they involve. The relative probability of such an event getting out of control was likely underestimated by a huge factor too, the central theme of Taleb's book. 

## **Predicting the Next COVID**

But what lessons can we draw? If what we know can't hurt us as we are already prepared for it, how can we prepare for what we do not yet know? Are we even able to fathom what we don't know? 

For my part, I believe there are three key tenets that we can apply to help us to begin noticing potential Black Swan events ahead of time: 

1. Expand your knowledge broadly

Learning about a wide range of topics can help us to have the necessary vigilance to notice possible events. Note that you do not always need to see the extraordinary event coming from miles away, in the case of a trader pre-covid, simply being ahead of his peers by a few days would have been enough to net huge profits. 

2. Take notice of obscure events

If we run with the idea of what we know can't hurt us, then we must be vigilant for obscure events that don't fit into any of our current mental models. A ripple in the ocean has shown it can become a wave, so we must have our eyes open to these ripples. Some people had their eyes open in December and January 19/20 when COVID began to emerge, but most of us were ignorant and disbelieving until February or March. Noticing the strange events early can help us to prepare. It would be interesting to understand how many 'ripples' do eventually turn into waves?

3. Apply knowledge across boundaries 

Finally cross-insemination of ideas. Applying knowledge across disciplines to open undiscovered avenues. Humans are incredibly bad at applying knowledge to external contexts. We are very domain specific and often are completely unable to take the simplest ideas to a new context. But spotting rare events will require this ability as it enables us to open avenues of discovery that we are not currently aware of. 

Despite these recommendations, it is very likely future events will arrive without us having a clue where they have come from. The very nature of these extreme events means that we did not know about them, and whilst we always aim to explain their occurrence post-fact, by then it is all too late. Are we likely to see another virus explode across the globe in the way COVID has? Honestly I doubt it, in the near future at least, as it is now a known evil that we will all be on the lookout for such situations. 

The next world changing event is coming, lets see if anyone spots it!
