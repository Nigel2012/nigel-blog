I am a Finance Professional and business founder with interests in product development, retail and tech. Currently Co-Founder and Director of Finance at [La Nostra Ciutat](https://lanostraciutat.co/) in Barcelona. Founded in 2016, La Nostra Ciutat works with design talent to create gift and homeware products which are sold through our retail locations. It is currently considered Barcelona's largest giftware chain.

My recent focus has been on development of technology products covering the business intelligence and machine learning spaces.

My undergraduate degree is in Business Administration from the University of Bath and I am currently pursuing a masters in Computer Science. Before founding La Nostra Ciutat I had previously worked in the Investment Banking industry, as well as founded several online retail companies. I was a finalist in the [Shell LiveWire UK Young Entrepreneur of the Year award ](https://www.shell.co.uk/media/2014-media-releases/daniel-murray-28-is-shell-livewire-young-entrepreneur-of-the-year/_jcr_content/par/textimage_3.disclaimer.html/aHR0cHM6Ly90d2l0dGVyLmNvbS9zaGVsbF9zb2NpZXR5/go.html)in 2014.
