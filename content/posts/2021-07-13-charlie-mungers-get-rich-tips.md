Invest what you can for life and live long

Life long learning

Know the edge of your competency

Don't predict the macroeconomic cycles, hold over all the tides

Count on more booms than busts

There will be few major opportunities, seize the big ones that come

Marry well

Get up and keep working every day

Get lucky
